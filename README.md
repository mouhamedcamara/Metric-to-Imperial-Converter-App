# Metric-to-Imperial-Converter-App

1. When opened it should display a title, welcome message, and a dropdown that lets you select either "weight", "length", or "volume"

2. When an option is selected, the user should be taken to a form when they can enter a number, select a corresponding starting unit (such as "millimeters" or "gallons"), select an ending unit (such as "feet" or "liters"), and click a button that says "convert"

3. Once the "convert" button is clicked, the result should be displayed on the screen, as well as a "start over" button that takes the user back to the home screen.

4. Make sure your app allows users to convert between any of the following (once they choose the appropriate selection on the home page). It should also allow them to convert in either direction (Metric to Imperial but also Imperial to Metric).
